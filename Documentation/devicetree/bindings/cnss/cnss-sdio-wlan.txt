* Qualcomm Technologies Inc Connectivity SubSystem Platform Driver

This platform driver adds support for the CNSS subsystem used for SDIO
based Wi-Fi devices. It also adds support to manage two 1.8V voltage
regulators and WLAN power enable 3.3V PMIC GPIO. The main purpose of this
device tree entry below is to invoke the CNSS SDIO platform driver
and provide handle to the WLAN power enable 3.3V pmic GPIO and two 1.8V
PMIC voltage regulator resources.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "qcom,cnss_sdio"
  - wlan-pmic-gpio: 3.3V PMIC GPIO for external power supply.
  - vdd-wlan-io-supply: phandle to the WLAN IO regulator device tree node.
  - vdd-wlan-xtal-supply: phandle to the WLAM XTAL regulator device tree node.

Example:
	qcom,cnss-sdio {
		compatible = "qcom,cnss_sdio";
		cnss_sdio,wlan-pmic-gpio = <&pm8019_gpios 3 0>;
		vdd-wlan-io-supply = <&mdmfermium_l11>;
		vdd-wlan-xtal-supply = <&mdmfermium_l2>;
	};
