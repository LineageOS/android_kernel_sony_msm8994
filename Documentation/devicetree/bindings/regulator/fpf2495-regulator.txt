FPF2495 Voltage regulators

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "fairchild,fpf2495-regulator";

Optional properties:
- gpio_en: gpio to use for enable control
- startup-delay-us: startup time in microseconds
- gpio_en-active_low: Polarity of gpio_en is Active low
If this property is missing, the default assumed is Active high.
- vin-supply: Input supply name.
- gpio_flag: gpio to use for receive a signel of flag pin.
- gpio_flag-active_high: Polarity of gpio_flag is Active high
If this property is missing, the default assumed is Active low.
- flag_pull-supply: Supply name to pull the flag pin.
- oc-delay-ms: dead time for inrush current on Vout.

Any property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.
However a fixed voltage regulator is expected to have the
regulator-min-microvolt and regulator-max-microvolt
to be the same.

These property does not work on this driver below:
  regulator-microvolt-offset
  regulator-boot-on
  regulator-always-on
  regulator-min-microamp
  regulator-max-microamp

Example:

	fpf2495_reg: fpf2495_reg {
		compatible = "fairchild,fpf2495-regulator";
		regulator-name = "fpf2495-reg";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <5000000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <5000000>;
		gpio_en = <&gpio1 16 0>;
		vin-supply = <&parent_reg>;
		flag_pull-supply = <&pull_reg>;
		gpio_flag = <&gpio5 3 0>;
		oc-delay-ms = <300>;
	};
